# Research achievements and peer recognition
I am a 34 years old Contract Researcher in Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia (Rome, Italy). 
My research is interdisciplinary, spanning in the fields of Structural Geology and Rock Deformation. I am devoted to the study of the seismic source by integrating classic Structural Geology methods (microstructural observations with electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction, Raman and FTIR spectroscopy) with innovative laboratory experiments that reproduce the extreme deformation conditions during earthquakes or landslide collapses, with a particular interest in developing novel techniques that allow us to measure the highest possible number of observables to better understand what controls the natural phenomena reproduced in the laboratory.

## Research achievements
I present here a short list of publications to highlight my research interests.

-

## Peer recognition
- 2017: Outstanding Student Poster and PICO Award, European Geosciences Union.
- 2023: Talk at international school: "Landslides mechanics: from complex granular behaviour to field-scale flows"

# Additional information

## Unconventional career paths

I transferred my Italian PhD from University of Padova to University of Manchester (supervisor Di Toro in both cases). However, the official supervisor of my PhD appeared as Stephen Covey-Crump (Supervisor), this happened because my supervisor just moved back from the University of Manchester to the University of Padova just a few months (September 2017) before the end of my PhD (December 2017).

## Other contributions to the research community

### Supervision of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows

- 2023:	Niccolò Cavaliere, Bachelor Thesis
  - Graduated on 20/07/2023
  - Dipartimento di Geoscienze, Università degli Studi di Padova, Italy
  - [Link to thesis](https://thesis.unipd.it/handle/20.500.12608/48966)

### Teaching activities
Even if they were not an entire course, teaching assistance activities were performed in:

- 2021: Structural Geology and Earthquakes, Università degli Studi di Padova, Italy (8 hours)
- 2021: Earthquake and Fault Mechanics, Università degli Studi di Padova, Italy (8 hours)
- 2022: Earthquake Geology and Fault Mechanics, Università degli Studi di Padova, Italy (7 hours)

- 2018 - now: Several laboratory visits in which the basic concepts of coseismic slip were presented to either the general public or to classes from local universities.

### Organisation of scientific meetings
In the last years I was involved in the organization of a scientific session at the European Geosciences Union that has been quite successful in terms of number and quality of contributions and of attendance.

- 2019: Co-convener, EGU General Assembly 2019 
- 2020: Co-convener, EGU General Assembly 2020 
- 2021: Co-convener, EGU General Assembly 2021
- 2023: Convener, EGU General Assembly 2023

### Institutional responsibilities
- 2023 - now: Qualification to perform the seismic monitoring activities at INGV.

### Reviewing activities
- 2018 - 2023: On average, three reviews were performed for each submitted first author manuscript. For a total of 17 reviews. Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth (3), Geophysical Research Letters (2), Nature Communications (1), Landslides (1), Scientific Reports (2), Tectonophysics (1), Journal of Structural Geology (1), Geology (2), Geochemistry Geophysics Geosystems (1), Geophysical Journal International (1).
- 2018 - 2023: One PhD thesis.

### Participation as Team Member in ERC projects
